# ReconMasta

This repository contains a bash script for reconnaissance tasks.

## Setup

Run `setup.sh` to install the required tools. The script uses `apt` and `go` to fetch binaries and updates nuclei templates.

```bash
sudo ./setup.sh
```

After installation you can run `ReconMasta.sh` normally.
